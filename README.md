#Convex Polygon class

In this project we want to implement a new class Convex Polygon.
First of all, I will comment the implementation of this class.
Let's start with the constructor, it will be a vector of points because as far as I'm concerned i'ts the best opcion because qe are always working with points. What's more, I also implemented a vector of doubles for the rgb colours of the Convex Polygon, so each Polygon will have specific colour.
